I think I have a great experience in DBMS. Compared to use sqlite in terminal, it has a great appearance
instead of all black. Also, the way it imports data is fast and unique, we can easily insert external data into
table. Moreover, the output format is more readable, we can clearly see the table. Finally, the way it reports
error is easy to understand and easy to debug. Thus, I really really really like DBMS cloud service!!!
